# RPG in C
(using Raylib)


Like the title says, a small rpg to practice C.

I have no plans on making this a complete project at this point.

Goals:
- Become more proficient in C in general.
- Achieve better understanding for large and complex data structures(tons of variable, stats, numbers in an RPG.)
- I keep wondering why we need dynamic allocation so I will challenge myself to never use it(unless raylib uses it under the hood I guess.)

>Why not C++?

C++ is a colossus of complexity and I'm barely proficient in C.

>OpenGL? Vulkan? D3D?

My head starts spinning when I'm just typing out boilerplate that I barely understand. 
Raylib seems like a good and simple starting point.

>Does this build?

It does for me. Probably not for you.
I'm using the quickstart thing from: https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart but I excluded most of it with the .gitignore because of the size.
