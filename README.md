# RPG in C
(using Raylib)<br>
<br>
This was a small rpg to practice C.<br>
I have no plans on making this a complete project at this point.<br>
<br>
Goals:
- Become more proficient in C in general.
>I used a ton of pointers and modules to overcome the simplicity of C but I feel it was never a headache, just more typing. 
- Achieve better understanding for large and complex data structures(tons of variable, stats, numbers in an RPG.)
>I learnt a lot about handling big amounts of data and also have a more solid understanding about pointers.
- I keep wondering why we need dynamic allocation so I will challenge myself to never use it(unless raylib uses it under the hood I guess.)
>It's possible that raylib and the cJSON parser uses dynamic allocation but I did not use it in the main codebase.<br>
>I never felt it was needed and in most cases would just complicate things further.
<br>
Misc:<br>
<br>
Why not C++?
>C++ is a colossus of complexity and I'm barely proficient in C.

OpenGL? Vulkan? D3D?
>My head starts spinning when I'm just typing out boilerplate that I barely understand. <br>
>Raylib seems like a good and simple starting point.

Does this build?
>It does for me. Probably not for you.<br>
>I'm using the quickstart thing from: https://github.com/raylib-extras/raylib-quickstart but I excluded most of it with the .gitignore because of the size.
